            <h2>ðŸŒˆ Amnesia and the CCSF X-ray Department</h2>
            <p>
                With all memories of my hometown washed away, I continued trying to get off welfare and began the long process of attending City College of San Francisco (CCSF) for an x-ray license. This journey took several years, but I was finally admitted to the program, where I excelled. However, what unfolded afterward was nothing short of egregious discrimination that merits serious investigation by an ethics board, if not a lawsuit.

Before I began my internship, I was informed by classmates that my clinical coordinator had been gossiping about my grades and personal aspects of my presentations. I reported this unprofessional behavior to the program director, who promised to look into it. After that, I heard nothing more. Soon after, while externing at the Mission Bernal campus, I was asked point-blank by an instructor if I "played in food." Not long after, I was called into the program directorâ€™s office and subjected to a 30-minute interrogation, during which I was again asked if I "played in food."

This line of questioning was not only irrelevant but deeply humiliating, especially as I was grappling with amnesia regarding past traumatic events. The personal nature of this harassment left me with severe PTSD, and I began to underperform as an intern, ultimately withdrawing from the program.

I attempted to raise my concerns about the departmentâ€™s behavior to the college chancellor, but my complaint was dismissed, and I was even advised that I could pursue legal action. The nature of the discrimination and harassment was so personal and distressing at the time that I couldnâ€™t bring myself to pursue a lawsuit. Instead, I chose to move on and enroll in another school to obtain my license. In hindsight, I now recognize that I had every right to sue for the blatant violations of privacy, professional conduct, and the discriminatory treatment I endured at CCSF.
