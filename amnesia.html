    Mid 2010s: By 2015, I had been dodging rumors about my past behavior for over a decade, and it had become exhausting. People constantly brought it up, and despite my efforts to move on, the rumors persisted. At one point, a drag queen showed curiosity about the rumors, so I made the mistake of taking her into an old chatroom where some fake photos, which I had staged years earlier, were still present. She was shocked, and I immediately apologized, even volunteering at a nonprofit she chose to make amends. But unfortunately, the situation escalated.
