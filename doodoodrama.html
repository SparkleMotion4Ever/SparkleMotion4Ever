            <h2>ðŸ’© Drama and Attempted Murder</h2>
<p>
    By 2015, I had been dodging rumors about my past for over a decade, and it had become exhausting. No matter how much time passed, the gossip persisted. At one point, a drag queen expressed curiosity about the rumors, and I made the mistake of showing her an old chatroom where some staged, fake photos from years earlier were still present. She was shocked, and I immediately apologized, even volunteering at a nonprofit of her choice to make amends. Unfortunately, despite my efforts, the situation quickly escalated.
</p>

<p>
    Word spread through the community, including to a bartender with whom I had a past relationship, and a fashion designer I had interacted with in those same chatrooms. While DJing at a local bathhouse, I was roofied by the fashion designer. In my disoriented state, I was coerced into confessing details to another drag queen, who publicly shared my confession and encouraged others to mock me. This incident left me traumatized, and I began to struggle with memory loss that would persist for years.
</p>

<p>
    Despite being told to stay away from the bar where the bartender worked, I kept returning due to my memory issues. During one visit, the bartender mentioned a pet being mistreated, leading me to uncover a network of abuse involving the petâ€™s parents and others in the community. When I threatened to report them to the police, they retaliated by publicly humiliating me. I was drugged and taunted in front of a group until I passed out. The trauma from this event worsened my memory issues, leaving me confused and disoriented. Looking back, I could have pursued legal action for the mistreatment and humiliation, but I was too overwhelmed at the time to do so.
</p>

<p>
    On one occasion, I returned to the bar at the bartenderâ€™s request for a DJ gig that never materialized. Instead, I was physically subdued by the bartender, the bar owner, and another person. During this attack, I suffered kidney failure, leaving me with near-total kidney function loss. These experiences left profound emotional and physical scars that still affect me today.
