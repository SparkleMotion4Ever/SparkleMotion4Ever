            <h2>ðŸŒˆ Drama and Attempted Murder</h2>
            <p>Mid 2010s: By 2015, I had been dodging rumors about my past behavior for over a decade, and it had become exhausting. People constantly brought it up, and despite my efforts to move on, the rumors persisted. At one point, a drag queen showed curiosity about the rumors, so I made the mistake of taking her into an old chatroom where some fake photos, which I had staged years earlier, were still present. She was shocked, and I immediately apologized, even volunteering at a nonprofit she chose to make amends. But unfortunately, the situation escalated.

                Rumors spread to others in the community, including a bartender with whom I had a past relationship. One night, while DJing at a local bathhouse, I was roofied by a local fashion designer. In my groggy state, I was coerced into confessing details to a drag queen, who then publicly shared my confession, even encouraging others at the club to jeer at me. This incident left me traumatized, and I began struggling with memory loss that persisted for years.
                
                Despite this, I kept returning to the bar where the bartender worked, even though I had been told to stay away. During one visit, the bartender mentioned a pet being mistreated by the community. I began investigating and eventually confronted the petâ€™s parents, who were linked to a larger group involved in similar abuse. This led to another incident where I was publicly humiliated and drugged in front of a gathering of people involved in the mistreatment. After this, my memory issues worsened, and I continued to suffer from confusion and disorientation.
                
                On one occasion, I returned to the bar at the bartenderâ€™s request for a DJ gig, only to be physically subdued by him, the bar owner, and another individual. I was attacked, and the aftermath left me with severe health problems, including near-total kidney failure. The trauma from these experiences has stayed with me, profoundly affecting both my physical and mental well-being.</p>
