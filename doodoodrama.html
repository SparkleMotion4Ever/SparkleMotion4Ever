            <h2>ðŸ’© Drama and Attempted Murder</h2>
<p>
    By 2015, I had been dodging rumors about my past behavior for over a decade, and it had become exhausting. No matter how much time passed, the gossip persisted. At one point, a drag queen showed curiosity about the rumors, and I made the mistake of taking her into an old chatroom where some staged, fake photos from years earlier were still present. She was shocked, and I immediately apologized, even volunteering at a nonprofit she chose to make amends. Unfortunately, the situation quickly escalated.
</p>

<p>
    Word spread through the community, including to a bartender with whom I had a past relationship. While DJing at a local bathhouse, I was roofied by a local fashion designer. In my disoriented state, I was coerced into confessing details to another drag queen, who publicly shared my confession and encouraged others to mock me. This incident left me traumatized, and I began to struggle with memory loss that would persist for years.
</p>

<p>
    Despite being told to stay away from the bar where the bartender worked, I kept returning due to my memory issues. On one visit, the bartender mentioned a pet being mistreated in the community, and I began investigating, only to uncover others involved in similar abusive behavior. This led to another public humiliation, where I was drugged in front of a group and taunted until I passed out. My memory issues worsened after this, and I continued to suffer from confusion and disorientation.
</p>

<p>
    On one occasion, I returned to the bar at the bartenderâ€™s request for a DJ gig that never materialized. Instead, I was physically subdued by the bartender, the bar owner, and another person. During this attack, I suffered kidney failure, leaving me with near-total kidney function loss. These experiences left profound emotional and physical scars that still affect me today.
