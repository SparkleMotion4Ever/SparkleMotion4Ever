            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>Childhood: On the surface, my childhood might have seemed idyllic, but behind closed doors, it was marked by abuse at the hands of my father. This continued until I was 10 and profoundly shaped my understanding of resilience and survival. While those early years were far from what they appeared, they became a crucial part of my journey toward healing and self-discovery, helping me become the person I am today.</p>
