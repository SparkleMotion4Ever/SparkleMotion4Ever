            <h2>Childhood and Adolescence</h2>
            <p>Childhood: On the surface, my early years may have seemed idyllic, but behind closed doors, it was marked by abuse at the hands of my father and other men. This continued until I was 16 and could leave home. This profoundly shaped my understanding of resilience and survival. While those early years were far from what they appeared, they became a crucial part of my journey toward healing and self-discovery, helping me become the person I am today.</p>

            <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
            <p>In my 20s, I struggled with the long-term effects of the trauma I experienced as a child and teenager. These years were marked by various mental health challenges, including bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other complex conditions. My journey also included behaviors and struggles related to coping mechanisms and the use of illegal drugs. While this period was extremely difficult, it played a significant role in my path toward understanding my mental health and ultimately pursuing healing and stability.</p>
