            <h2>Childhood and Adolescence</h2>
            <p>Childhood: On the surface, my early years may have seemed idyllic, but behind closed doors, it was marked by abuse at the hands of my father and other men. This continued until I was 16 and could leave home. This profoundly shaped my understanding of resilience and survival. While those early years were far from what they appeared, they became a crucial part of my journey toward healing and self-discovery, helping me become the person I am today.</p>

            <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
            <p>In early adulthood I struggled with the long-term effects of the trauma I experienced as a child and teenager. These years were marked by various mental health challenges, including bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other complex conditions. My journey also included behaviors and struggles related to coping mechanisms and the use of illegal drugs <a href="doodoodrama.html">ðŸŒˆ</a>. While this period was extremely difficult, it played a significant role in my path toward understanding my mental health and ultimately pursuing healing and stability.</p>
